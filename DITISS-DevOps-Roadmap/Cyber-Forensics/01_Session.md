# SESSION 1 – INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER FORENSICS

---

## **1. Overview – Computer Forensics**

### **Definition**

* **Computer Forensics / Cyber Forensics / Digital Forensics**
  → Branch of forensic science dealing with **identification, collection, preservation, analysis, and presentation** of **digital evidence**.
* Evidence must be **legally admissible**, **authentic**, and **unaltered**.

### **Scope**

Investigates cybercrimes such as:

* Hacking
* Data breaches
* Online fraud
* Identity theft
* Intellectual property theft
* Cyberstalking & harassment
* Malware-related incidents

### **Key Objectives**

* Identify & preserve digital evidence
* Recover deleted / hidden data
* Reconstruct events & timelines
* Present findings as **legal evidence**
* Provide **expert testimony**

### **Digital Evidence Includes**

* Emails, SMS, chat logs
* Images, videos, documents
* Computer files & folders
* System & application logs
* Internet history
* Metadata (timestamps, user info, geolocation)

📌 **MCQ Trap**:
Digital evidence = **electronically stored or transmitted data** (NOT physical documents)

## **2. Difference – Computer Crime vs Unauthorized Activities**

| Aspect       | Computer Crime                         | Unauthorized Activities                      |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Nature       | **Illegal**                            | **Policy / rule violation**                  |
| Legal Status | Punishable by law                      | May not be criminal                          |
| Intent       | Malicious / unlawful                   | May be accidental or intentional             |
| Examples     | Hacking, phishing, DoS, identity theft | Policy violation, unauthorized access        |
| Consequences | Jail, fines, prosecution               | Termination, access revocation, civil action |

📌 **MCQ Trap**:

* All computer crimes are unauthorized activities
* ❌ All unauthorized activities are **NOT** computer crimes

## **3. Cyber Laws**

### **Definition**

* Legal frameworks governing:

  * Use of computers
  * Internet & digital technologies
  * Cybercrimes
  * Digital evidence
  * Privacy & data protection

### **Types of Cybercrimes Covered**

* Unauthorized access & hacking
* Data theft & breaches
* Identity theft
* Online fraud & phishing
* Cyberstalking & harassment
* Malware distribution
* Intellectual property infringement
* Cyberterrorism

### **Key Elements of Cyber Laws**

* Definition of cybercrimes & penalties
* Jurisdiction (cross-border crimes)
* Digital evidence handling & admissibility
* Privacy & data protection
* Cybersecurity obligations
* Electronic transactions & digital signatures

### **International Cooperation**

* Cybercrimes are **borderless**
* **Budapest Convention on Cybercrime** promotes cooperation

📌 **MCQ Trap**:

* Cyber laws include **both crime prevention AND evidence admissibility**

## **4. Process of Computer Forensics (Six Stages)**

### **1. Identification & Preparation**

* Identify incident & objectives
* Secure crime scene
* Prevent evidence tampering
* Assign roles & resources

### **2. Collection of Evidence**

* Identify devices, systems, networks
* Create **forensic images**
* Preserve original evidence
* Maintain **chain of custody**

### **3. Examination & Analysis**

* Analyze disk, logs, memory, metadata
* Recover deleted / hidden files
* Use keyword search, data carving, decryption

### **4. Reconstruction & Interpretation**

* Reconstruct sequence of events
* Build timelines
* Identify patterns, anomalies, correlations

### **5. Documentation & Reporting**

* Document tools, methods, findings
* Prepare clear forensic report
* Report must be understandable to **technical & non-technical** audiences

### **6. Presentation & Expert Testimony**

* Present evidence in court
* Explain methodology
* Answer cross-examination questions

📌 **Mnemonic (MCQ-friendly)**
**I-C-A-R-D-P**
Identification → Collection → Analysis → Reconstruction → Documentation → Presentation

## **5. Need for Forensics Investigator**

### **1. Criminal Investigations**

* Identify attackers
* Trace cybercrime origin
* Provide court-admissible evidence

### **2. Incident Response**

* Determine cause & impact
* Contain breach
* Restore systems
* Recommend security improvements

### **3. Employee Misconduct**

* Investigate data theft, misuse, unauthorized access
* Analyze emails, logs, file access records
* Support disciplinary or legal action

### **4. Civil Litigation**

* Analyze digital evidence in disputes
* Act as expert witness
* Support or refute legal claims

### **5. Data Recovery**

* Recover deleted or lost data
* Reconstruct damaged or encrypted data

### **6. Compliance & Auditing**

* Ensure regulatory compliance
* Identify policy gaps
* Strengthen security controls

📌 **MCQ Trap**:

* Forensic investigators are required in **criminal, civil, corporate, and compliance cases**

# **EXAM HIGHLIGHTS (Very Important for MCQs)**

* Forensics focuses on **legal admissibility**
* Evidence integrity is ensured using **forensic imaging & chain of custody**
* Unauthorized ≠ Illegal
* Cyber laws include **privacy + evidence handling**
* Process has **SIX stages** (sequence matters)
* Investigator role is **technical + legal**

---

## **Corrections / Improvements / Suggested Substitutions**

1. **Correct term**:

   * Use **“Computer Forensics”** instead of mixing cyber/computer inconsistently (exam clarity).
2. **Process standardization**:

   * Clearly remember **six-stage process** (some books show 5 or 7 → PG-DITISS prefers 6).
3. **Differentiate clearly**:

   * Unauthorized activities ≠ cybercrime (common MCQ trap).
4. **Cyber laws**:

   * Include **evidence admissibility & jurisdiction** — often missed in answers.
5. **Avoid tool-heavy content** in Session 1 answers unless explicitly asked.


Just tell me 👍
