# SESSION 6 – STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES & PROCESSING CRIME / INCIDENT SCENES (WINDOWS & DOS SYSTEMS)

---

## **1. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**

### **Concept Overview**

* **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** are **predefined, documented instructions** that describe **how forensic activities must be performed**.
* SOPs ensure **consistency, accuracy, legal compliance, and repeatability** in cyber forensics.

---

### **Objectives of SOPs**

* Maintain **forensic soundness**
* Ensure **evidence integrity**
* Support **legal admissibility**
* Reduce investigator error
* Standardize investigation process

---

### **Key Features of SOPs**

* Clearly defined steps
* Approved tools & techniques
* Roles and responsibilities
* Documentation requirements
* Compliance with laws & standards

---

### **Why SOPs are Important in Forensics**

* Prevent evidence contamination
* Maintain chain of custody
* Ensure uniform investigations
* Enable audit & review
* Support expert testimony

📌 **MCQ Trap**

* SOPs are **mandatory**, not optional
* SOPs ≠ incident response plan

---

## **2. Processing Crime and Incident Scenes – Working with Windows & DOS Systems (Current)**

### **Concept Overview**

* Processing a crime or incident scene involves **identifying, collecting, preserving, and documenting digital evidence** from systems running **Windows or DOS**.
* Must follow **forensic best practices** and SOPs.

---

## **3. Steps in Processing Crime / Incident Scenes**

---

### **1. Secure the Scene**

* Restrict access to authorized personnel
* Prevent tampering or contamination
* Record initial condition of scene

📌 **MCQ Trap**

* Securing the scene is the **first step**

---

### **2. Identify the Type of System**

* Determine:

  * Windows OS (version)
  * DOS-based system
* Helps decide:

  * Tools
  * Techniques
  * Evidence sources

📌 **MCQ Trap**

* Tool selection depends on OS type

---

### **3. Document System Information**

#### **Record**

* Make, model, serial number
* OS version
* Installed software
* Hardware configuration

📌 **MCQ Trap**

* Documentation starts **before** evidence collection

---

### **4. Photography & Documentation**

* Capture:

  * System setup
  * Peripheral devices
  * Cable connections
  * External storage devices

📌 **MCQ Trap**

* Visual documentation is part of **chain of custody**

---

### **5. Power-Off & Disconnect (With Caution)**

* If powered ON:

  * Decide **live vs dead analysis**
* Disconnect power & peripherals **only if safe**

📌 **MCQ Trap**

* Improper shutdown may destroy volatile evidence

---

### **6. Forensic Imaging**

* Create **bit-by-bit forensic image**
* Use approved forensic tools
* Original media must remain **unchanged**

📌 **MCQ Trap**

* Imaging ≠ file copy

---

### **7. Hash Verification**

* Calculate hash values:

  * Before imaging
  * After imaging
* Hashes must match

📌 **MCQ Trap**

* Hash mismatch = evidence integrity failure

---

### **8. Live System Analysis (If Required)**

#### **Collect Volatile Data**

* Running processes
* Network connections
* Open files
* System memory (RAM)

📌 **MCQ Trap**

* Volatile data is lost after shutdown

---

### **9. Data Recovery**

* Recover:

  * Deleted files
  * Hidden data
* Use forensic recovery tools

📌 **MCQ Trap**

* Recovery is done on **forensic copy**

---

### **10. Preserve & Document Findings**

* Maintain chain of custody
* Store evidence securely
* Prepare detailed logs & notes

📌 **MCQ Trap**

* Poor documentation weakens evidence in court

---

## **Important Facts / Points for MCQs**

* SOPs ensure repeatability
* Windows/DOS systems require OS-specific handling
* Imaging must be bit-by-bit
* Volatile data is time-sensitive
* Hashing validates integrity
* Documentation is continuous

---

## **MCQ Pointers / Exam Traps**

* SOPs vs policies
* File copy vs forensic image
* Live analysis vs dead analysis
* Volatile vs non-volatile data
* Documentation before vs after acquisition
* Hashing vs encryption

---

## **Corrections / Improvements / Suggested Substitutions**

1. **Terminology**

   * Use *“forensic imaging”* instead of *backup*
2. **Clarification**

   * SOPs apply to **all stages** of investigation
3. **Exam Focus**

   * Windows/DOS handling questions often test **shutdown vs live analysis**
4. **Best Practice**

   * Always hash before & after imaging
5. **Common Error**

   * Never analyze the original system directly
