## 🧭 Who Owns “The Internet”?

The internet is not owned by any individual or group. The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks (internetwork or internet for short), cooperating with each other to exchange information using common standards. Through telephone wires, fiber-optic cables, wireless transmissions, and satellite links, internet users can exchange information in a variety of forms, as shown in the figure.

Everything that you access online is located somewhere on the global internet. Social media sites, multiplayer games, messaging centers that provide email, online courses — all of these internet destinations are connected to local networks that send and receive information through the internet.

Think about all of the interactions that you have during the day which require you to be online.

## 🖧 1.1 Local Networks
Local networks come in all sizes. They can range from simple networks consisting of two computers, to networks connecting hundreds of thousands of devices. Networks installed in small offices, or homes and home offices, are referred to as small office/home office (SOHO) networks. SOHO networks let you share resources such as printers, documents, pictures, and music, between a few local users.

In business, large networks can be used to advertise and sell products, order supplies, and communicate with customers. Communication over a network is usually more efficient and less expensive than traditional forms of communication, such as regular mail or long distance phone calls. Networks allow for rapid communication such as email and instant messaging, and provide consolidation and access to information stored on network servers.

Business and SOHO networks usually provide a shared connection to the internet. The internet is considered a "network of networks" because it is literally made up of thousands of local networks that are connected to each other.

### 🏠 Small Home Networks
Small home networks connect a few computers to each other and to the internet.

### 💼 Small Office and Home Office Networks
The SOHO network allows computers in a home office or a remote office to connect to a corporate network, or access centralized, shared resources.

### 🏫 Medium to Large Networks
Medium to large networks, such as those used by corporations and schools, can have many locations with hundreds or thousands of interconnected hosts.


### 🌏 World Wide Networks
The internet is a network of networks that connects hundreds of millions of computers world-wide.

### 📱 Mobile Devices
The internet connects more computing devices than just desktop and laptop computers. There are devices all around that you may interact with on a daily basis that are also connected to the internet. These include mobile devices, home devices, and a variety of other connected devices.
- Smartphones are able to connect to the internet from almost anywhere.

### Connected Home Devices
Many of the things in your home can also be connected to the internet so that they can be monitored and configured remotely.
- 🔐 Security System : 
Many of the items in a home, such as security systems, lighting, and climate controls, can be monitored and configured remotely using a mobile device.
- 📺 Smart TV :
A smart TV can be connected to the internet to access content without the need for TV service provider equipment. Also, a smart TV can allow a user to browse the web, compose email, or display video, audio, or photos stored on a computer.

## 💾 1.2 Data Transmission


### The Bit

Did you know that computers and networks only work with binary digits, zeros and ones? It can be difficult to imagine that all of our data is stored and transmitted as a series of bits. Each bit can only have one of two possible values, 0 or 1. The term bit is an abbreviation of “binary digit” and represents the smallest piece of data. Humans interpret words and pictures, computers interpret only patterns of bits.

A bit is stored and transmitted as one of two possible discrete states. This can include two directions of magnetization, two distinct voltage or current levels, two distinct levels of light intensity, or any other physical system of two discrete states. For example, a light switch can be either On or Off; in binary representation, these states would correspond to 1 and 0 respectively.

Every input device (mouse, keyboard, voice-activated receiver) will translate human interaction into binary code for the CPU to process and store. Every output device (printer, speakers, monitors, etc.) will take binary data and translate it back into human recognizable form. Within the computer itself, all data is processed and stored as binary.

Computers use binary codes to represent and interpret letters, numbers and special characters with bits. A commonly used code is the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). With ASCII, each character is represented by eight bits. For example:

Capital letter: A = 01000001
Number: 9 = 00111001
Special character: # = 00100011
Each group of eight bits, such as the representations of letters and numbers, is known as a byte.

Codes can be used to represent almost any type of information digitally including computer data, graphics, photos, voice, video, and music.

### 📡 Common Methods of Data Transmission

After the data is transformed into a series of bits, it must be converted into signals that can be sent across the network media to its destination. Media refers to the physical medium on which the signals are transmitted. Examples of media are copper wire, fiber-optic cable, and electromagnetic waves through the air. A signal consists of electrical or optical patterns that are transmitted from one connected device to another. These patterns represent the digital bits (i.e. the data) and travel across the media from source to destination as either a series of pulses of electricity, pulses of light, or radio waves. Signals may be converted many times before ultimately reaching the destination, as corresponding media changes between source and destination.

There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks:

- ⚡ Electrical signals - Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
- 💡 Optical signals - Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
- 📶 Wireless signals - Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.

## 1.3 Bandwidth and Throughput

### Bandwidth 
Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data.
| ⚙️ Units of Bandwidth | 🔠 Abbreviation | 🔁 Equivalence                    |
| --------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Bit per second        | **bps**         | 1 bit per second                  |
| Kilobit per second    | **kbps**        | 1,000 bits per second             |
| Megabit per second    | **Mbps**        | 1,000,000 bits per second         |
| Gigabit per second    | **Gbps**        | 1,000,000,000 bits per second     |
| Terabit per second    | **Tbps**        | 1,000,000,000,000 bits per second |


### 🚀 Throughput
Like bandwidth, throughput is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time. However, due to a number of factors, throughput does not usually match the specified bandwidth. Many factors influence throughput including:

- The amount of data being sent and received over the connection
- The types of data being transmitted
- The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination

Latency refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.

Throughput measurements do not take into account the validity or usefulness of the bits being transmitted and received. Many messages received through the network are not destined for specific user applications. An example would be network control messages that regulate traffic and correct errors.

In an internetwork or network with multiple segments, throughput cannot be faster than the slowest link of the path from sending device to the receiving device. Even if all or most of the segments have high bandwidth, it will only take one segment in the path with lower bandwidth to create a slowdown of the throughput of the entire network.

There are many online speed tests that can reveal the throughput of an internet connection.

### 👥 2.1 Client and Server Roles
All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts. Hosts can send and receive messages on the network. In modern networks, computer hosts can act as a client, a server, or both, as shown in the figure. The software installed on the computer determines which role the computer plays.
 - Server : 
Servers are hosts that have software installed which enable them to provide services.
Each service requires separate server software

- Client :
Clients are computer hosts that have software installed that enables the hosts to request and display the information obtained from the server.

###  🔄 2.2 Peer-to-Peer Networks

Client and server software usually run on separate computers, but it is also possible for one computer to run both client and server software at the same time. In small businesses and homes, many computers function as the servers and clients on the network. This type of network is called a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.

The simplest P2P network consists of two directly connected computers using either a wired or wireless connection. Both computers are then able to use this simple network to exchange data and services with each other, acting as either a client or a server as necessary.

Multiple PCs can also be connected to create a larger P2P network, but this requires a network device, such as a switch, to interconnect the computers.

The main disadvantage of a P2P environment is that the performance of a host can be slowed down if it is acting as both a client and a server at the same time. The figure lists some of the advantages and disadvantages of peer-to-peer networks.
In larger businesses, because of the potential for high amounts of network traffic, it is often necessary to have dedicated servers to support the number of service requests.

The advantages and disadvantages of P2P networking are summarized in the figure.

The figure shows a small network with three devices. A printer is on the left, connected to a print sharing PC in the middle, which is also connected to a file sharing PC on the right. Under the topology is a list of the advantages and disadvantage of peer-to-peer networking. The advantages of peer-to-peer networking are: easy to set up, less complex, lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required, and can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers. The disadvantages of peer-to-peer networking are: no centralized administration, not as secure, not scalable, all devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow their performance.
