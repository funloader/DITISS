### 🛠️ **NIST CSF – Five Core Functions** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is structured around **five core functions** that represent the **lifecycle of cybersecurity risk management**. These functions provide a **high-level, strategic view** of how organizations manage cybersecurity risk.

| **CSF Function**  | **Purpose (One-Line for MCQs)**                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identify (ID)** | Understand organizational environment, assets, risks, and dependencies |
| **Protect (PR)**  | Implement safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services           |
| **Detect (DE)**   | Identify the occurrence of cybersecurity events                        |
| **Respond (RS)**  | Take action to contain and mitigate cybersecurity incidents            |
| **Recover (RC)**  | Restore services and improve resilience after incidents                |

---

### 📌 **Key Exam Notes (Very Important)**

* The **5 CSF Functions** apply to **all organizations**, regardless of size or sector.
* Functions are:

  * **Sequential in concept** (Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover)
  * **Not strictly linear** in real-world implementation.
* Each function contains:

  * **Categories** → **Subcategories** → **Informative References**
* These functions form the **foundation of the CSF Core**.

---

### ⚠️ **MCQ Traps & Confusions**

* ❌ CSF Functions ≠ CSF Tiers
* ❌ CSF Functions ≠ Incident Response phases only
* ✅ CSF Functions = **Strategic cybersecurity lifecycle**

> [!NOTE]
> **Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover**

---

### F. CSF Implementation Tiers

* Describe **maturity of risk management practices**

| Tier       | Name          | Nature                        |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Tier 1** | Partial       | Ad-hoc, reactive              |
| **Tier 2** | Risk Informed | Risk-aware but inconsistent   |
| **Tier 3** | Repeatable    | Formal, documented            |
| **Tier 4** | Adaptive      | Agile, continuously improving |

### G. CSF Organizational Profiles

* Used to represent **current and target cybersecurity posture**
* **Steps:**

  1. Scope the profile
  2. Gather organizational information
  3. Create Current & Target Profile
  4. Perform gap analysis
  5. Implement action plan & update profile

2. Orient
3. Create Current Profile
4. Conduct Risk Assessment
5. Create Target Profile
6. Determine Gaps
7. Implement Action Plan

### I. Integration with Other Standards

| Standard        | Focus                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| ISO/IEC 27001   | Information security controls |
| COBIT           | IT governance                 |
| CIS Controls    | Technical security baseline   |
| HIPAA / PCI DSS | Sector-specific compliance    |

## 4. Important Facts / Points for MCQs

* NIST CSF is **risk-based**, not control-based.
* CSF focuses on **outcomes**, not specific technologies.
* CSF is applicable to **all organizations** (size & sector neutral).
* CSF supports **enterprise risk management**, not only IT risk.
* CSF 2.0 emphasizes integration with **financial, privacy, supply chain, and reputational risks**.

### 🏦 Banking Use Case
Use Case: A mid-sized bank wants to align with FFIEC and NIST CSF to strengthen cybersecurity posture.

**Actions Taken:**
* Identify: Mapped all digital assets and third-party vendors.
* Protect: Implemented encryption and IAM.
* Detect: Introduced SIEM for anomaly detection.
* Respond: Developed incident response playbooks.
* Recover: Built backup and disaster recovery procedures.

* Aligns with **FFIEC & NIST CSF**
* Result:

  * 40% faster phishing detection
  * 25% fewer audit non-conformities
 
* Visual: Before/After bar chart or radar chart of security posture.

### 🏥 Healthcare Use Case

* Used for **HIPAA compliance**
* Focus on PHI protection
* Improved audit readiness
* Visual: Process map showing patient data flow with security controls
overlaid.

## 6. MCQ Pointers / Exam Traps

* ❌ CSF is **not mandatory** → It is **voluntary**
* ❌ CSF ≠ ISO 27001 (ISO is certification-based)
* ✔ CSF Core = Functions + Categories + Subcategories
* ✔ Tiers indicate **maturity**, not compliance
* ❌ CSF does **not prescribe tools or controls**
* ✔ Profiles = Current vs Target posture
* ❌ CSF Core is **outcome-based**, not control-based

---

✅ **Exam Priority Reminder:**
Focus on **definitions, CSF components, Functions, Tiers, Profiles, and comparisons with ISO/COBIT** for PG-DITISS MCQs.
