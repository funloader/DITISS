## 🧩 PART ONE: Auditing Internal Controls in an IT Environment (Ch. 1–5)

### 🔹 Chapter 1: SOX & COSO Internal Control Framework

📌 **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) Section 404**

* Requires management to **design, document, and test internal controls**

* Defines internal control as a process designed to provide **reasonable assurance**
* **Three Objectives**:

  * ⚙️ Operations effectiveness & efficiency
  * 📊 Reliability of financial reporting
  * 📜 Compliance with laws & regulations

📌 **Five COSO Components**

1. 🏛️ Control Environment – tone at the top, ethics, governance
2. ⚠️ Risk Assessment – identifying & analyzing risks
3. 🔐 Control Activities – policies, procedures, approvals
4. 📡 Information & Communication – data flow & reporting
5. 🔍 Monitoring – ongoing & independent evaluations

📌 **Role of IT Auditors**

* Validate automated controls
* Assess system reliability
* Bridge business controls and IT processes

### 🔹 Chapter 2: Using COBIT to Perform IT Audits

📌 **COBIT (Control Objectives for Information & Related Technology)**

* ISACA-developed **IT governance and control framework**
* More **IT-centric** than COSO
* Used to **map IT controls to business objectives**

📌 **COBIT vs COSO**

* COSO = enterprise-wide internal control
* COBIT = IT processes supporting COSO

📌 **Four COBIT Domains**

1. 🧠 Plan & Organize
2. 🛠️ Acquire & Implement
3. 🚚 Deliver & Support
4. 📈 Monitor & Evaluate

📌 **SOX Compliance**

* COBIT provides **detailed IT control objectives**
* Helps test IT general & application controls

---

### 🔹 Chapter 3: IIA & ISACA Professional Standards

📌 **IIA – IPPF (International Professional Practices Framework)**

* Mandatory standards for internal auditing
* Independence, objectivity, due professional care

📌 **GTAGs (Global Technology Audit Guides)**

* Practical IT audit guidance
* Non-mandatory but highly recommended

📌 **ISACA Standards**

* Focus on information systems audit
* CISA-aligned audit methodology

📌 **Codes of Ethics**

* Integrity, confidentiality, competency, objectivity
* Applies to both IIA & ISACA members

---

### 🔹 Chapter 4: Risk Management via COSO ERM

📌 **COSO ERM Framework**

* Expands COSO internal control to **enterprise risk**
* Integrates strategy, performance, and governance

📌 **Eight ERM Components**

1. Internal Environment
2. Objective Setting
3. Event Identification
4. Risk Assessment
5. Risk Response
6. Control Activities
7. Information & Communication
8. Monitoring

📌 **Risk Analysis**

* Quantitative: probabilities, financial impact
