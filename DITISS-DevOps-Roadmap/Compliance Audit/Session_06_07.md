# ISO/IEC 2700x Series & ISO/IEC 27001 – Structure, History, Working & Domains

---

## 1. Concept Overview

* **ISO (International Organization for Standardization)**

  * Independent, **non-governmental international organization**
  * Develops and publishes **international standards**
* **ISO/IEC 2700x series**

  * Family of standards related to **Information Security Management**
* **ISO/IEC 27001**

  * **Core certifiable standard** of the 2700x family
  * Specifies requirements for **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**

---

## 2. Key Definitions (MCQ-Oriented)

* **ISMS (Information Security Management System):**
  A systematic approach to managing sensitive information using **people, processes, and technology** through **risk management**.
* **CIA Triad:**

  * **Confidentiality:** No unauthorized access
  * **Integrity:** Accuracy & completeness of information
  * **Availability:** Accessible when needed
* **Annex A:**
  A **catalog of security controls** selected based on risk assessment.
* **Statement of Applicability (SoA):**
  Document listing **all Annex A controls** with justification for **inclusion/exclusion**.
* **PDCA Cycle:**
  Plan – Do – Check – Act (foundation of ISO management standards)

## 3. Main Content (Organized as per Syllabus)

### A. ISO/IEC 2700x Family (Important for MCQs)

| Standard      | Purpose                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ISO/IEC 27001 | ISMS requirements (certifiable)      |
| ISO/IEC 27002 | Code of practice / control guidance  |
| ISO/IEC 27005 | Information security risk management |
| ISO/IEC 27017 | Cloud security controls              |
| ISO/IEC 27018 | Protection of PII in cloud           |
 
> [!NOTE]
>  Only **ISO/IEC 27001** is certifiable.

---

### B. How ISO/IEC 27001 Standard Works

1. **Risk-Based Approach**

   * Identify risks → Analyze → Evaluate
2. **Risk Treatment**

   * Select appropriate controls (Annex A)
3. **Implementation via PDCA**

   * Plan: Scope, risk assessment
   * Do: Implement controls
   * Check: Internal audit, monitoring
   * Act: Corrective actions
4. **Continual Improvement**

   * ISMS is **ongoing**, not one-time

### C. History of ISO/IEC 27001 (Exam-Focused Timeline)

| Year     | Event                                     |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 2005     | ISO/IEC 27001:2005 first released         |
| 2013     | Major revision (14 domains, 114 controls) |
| Oct 2022 | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 published              |
| May 2024 | New audits must follow 2022 version       |
| Oct 2025 | End of transition from 2013 to 2022       |

---

### D. ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Domains (Very Important)

ISO/IEC 27001:2005 had **11 security domains**:

1. Security Policy
2. Organization of Information Security
3. Asset Management
4. Human Resources Security
5. Physical & Environmental Security
6. Communications & Operations Management
7. Access Control

11. Compliance

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * 2005 → **11 domains**
> * 2013 → **14 domains**
> * 2022 → **4 themes**

### E. Structure of ISO/IEC 27001 Standard

#### 1. Clauses (0–10)

* **Clauses 0–3:** Introductory / Informational
* **Clauses 4–10:** **Mandatory requirements**

| Clause | Name                        |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| 4      | Context of the Organization |
| 5      | Leadership                  |
| 6      | Planning                    |
| 7      | Support                     |
| 8      | Operation                   |
| 9      | Performance Evaluation      |
| 10     | Improvement                 |

#### 2. Annex A (Controls Section)

* Provides **security controls**, not mandatory checklist
* Selection depends on **risk assessment**
* Justified in **SoA**

Annex A provides a catalog of 93 security controls, grouped into four themes:
* **Organizational controls (A.5):** Policies, procedures, responsibilities, asset management.
* **People controls (A.6):** Training, awareness, screening, HR security.
* **Physical controls (A.7):** Physical and environmental security measures.
* **Technological controls (A.8):** IT security, technical safeguards, system management.

### F. ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A Structure (For Comparison)

| Feature        | 2013       | 2022       |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Domains/Themes | 14 domains | 4 themes   |
| Total Controls | 114        | 93         |
| New Controls   | –          | 11         |
| Themes         | –          | A.5 to A.8 |

**4 Themes (2022):**

* **A.5 Organizational**
* **A.6 People**
* **A.7 Physical**
* **A.8 Technological**

---

## 4. Important Facts / Points for MCQs

* ISO = **International Organization for Standardization**
* ISO is **non-governmental**
* ISO/IEC 27001 focuses on **ISMS**, not product security
* Annex A is **selective**, not compulsory
* Certification validity = **3 years** (with annual surveillance audits)
* Major non-conformity → **Certification denied**

---

## 5. Examples (Exam-Relevant)

* **A.8.2 User Authentication:**
  Strong passwords, MFA
* **A.6.3 Awareness:**
  Security training, phishing simulations

---

## 6. MCQ Pointers / Exam Traps

* ISO ≠ IEC (ISO + IEC jointly publish 27001)
* Annex A ≠ mandatory controls
* SoA ≠ Risk Assessment report
* 27001 = requirements, 27002 = guidance
* CIA Triad ≠ Risk Triad
* 2005 domains ≠ 2022 themes

---

✅ **PG-DITISS Exam Priority:**
Remember **numbers (domains, controls)**, **version differences**, **definitions**, and **SoA vs Annex A distinction**.
