## **COBIT 2019 Summary and Key Points**

### **1. Purpose of COBIT Implementation**

* **Enterprise-wide IT Governance:** IT is pervasive; governance should integrate business and IT, not treat them separately.
* **Program Management:** Governance implementations often fail without proper sponsorship, scope, and objectives. COBIT encourages a **program/project approach** for structured improvement.
* **Empowerment & Sustainability:** The goal is to embed IT governance into normal business practice, with stakeholders taking ownership of decisions.

---

### **2. COBIT Implementation Approach**

COBIT 2019 recommends **seven phases** for implementation:

1. **What are the drivers?**

   * Identify internal/external events or trends that require change.
   * Prepare a business case with risks and benefits.

2. **Where are we now?**

   * Assess current IT and governance capability.
   * Align IT goals with enterprise strategy and risk priorities.

3. **Where do we want to be?**

   * Define target capabilities.
   * Perform **gap analysis** and prioritize quick wins.

4. **What needs to be done?**

   * Plan projects and changes with solid business cases.

5. **How do we get there?**

   * Implement solutions, monitor performance, ensure alignment.

6. **Did we get there?**

   * Transition improvements into normal operations.
   * Measure performance and benefits realization.

7. **How do we keep the momentum going?**

   * Review success, identify further improvements, and sustain continual improvement.

**Program management** ensures checkpoints, risk updates, and benefit realization across all phases.

### **3. COBIT vs Other Standards**

* COBIT is an **umbrella framework**.
* Aligns with: ITIL, ISO/IEC standards (27001, 38500), COSO ERM, NIST Cybersecurity, CMMI, TOGAF, PROSCI, King IV, and more.
* COBIT **does not replace** other standards; it complements and references them for a holistic governance approach.

| Structure       | 5 domains: EDM, APO, BAI, DSS, MEA                         | 5 stages: Strategy, Design, Transition, Operation, Improvement |

**Key Takeaways:**

* COBIT: strategic, governance-focused, used by auditors and senior management.
* ITIL: tactical, operational, used by IT service teams.
* Many mature organizations implement **both**: COBIT for governance, ITIL for operational effectiveness.
