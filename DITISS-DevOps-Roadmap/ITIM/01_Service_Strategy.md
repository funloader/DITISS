---

## 5. Examples (Exam-Relevant)

---

## 6. MCQ Pointers / Exam Traps

* ❌ ITIL is **NOT a standard** → It is a **best-practice framework**
* ❌ Service Strategy ≠ Service Design
* Demand Management ≠ Capacity Management
* Portfolio Management ≠ Service Catalogue Management
* Financial Management ≠ Accounting only
* Utility = *What* | Warranty = *How well*

---

## 7. Corrections / Improvements / Suggested Substitutions

* PPT implies Demand Management only reduces uncertainty → **Correct:** It reduces but cannot eliminate uncertainty
* Financial Management scope should explicitly include **budgeting, costing, and charging**
* Service Strategy should explicitly mention **Strategic Asset concept** (important exam term)
* Service Provider Types not clearly structured in PPT → Structured as Type I, II, III for exam clarity
