# **Session 14 – Log Analyzer & SIEM (PG-DITISS)**

---

## 1. **Concept Overview**

Session 14 introduces **logs, log analysis, and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** with focus on:

* Collecting and analyzing logs
* **Correlation of events**
* **Triggering alerts/incidents**
* Centralized security monitoring

Core idea:

> **SIEM converts raw logs into meaningful security events and actionable alerts**

---

## 2. **Key Definitions**

| Term             | Exam-Oriented Definition                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Log              | Record of events generated by systems                 |
| Log Analyzer     | Tool that collects and analyzes logs                  |
| SIEM             | Platform for centralized log management & correlation |
| Log Correlation  | Linking multiple logs to detect incidents             |
| Event Triggering | Generating alerts based on correlation rules          |

## 3. **Main Content (Organized as per Syllabus)**

---

## **A. Introduction of Log Analyzer**

### **Log Analyzer – Definition**

A **Log Analyzer**:

* Collects logs from multiple sources
* Parses and analyzes log data
* Helps in troubleshooting & security monitoring

---

### **Why Log Analysis is Needed**

* Detect suspicious activities
* Investigate incidents
* Meet compliance requirements
* Support forensic analysis

📌 *Logs are primary evidence in security investigations*

---

## **B. Log**

---

### **Log – Definition**

A **log** is:

* A chronological record of events
* Generated by systems, applications, and network devices

---

### **Common Log Sources (MCQ Favorite)**

* Operating systems
* Firewalls
* IDS / IPS
* Routers & switches
* Servers & applications
* Authentication systems

📌 *Every security device generates logs*

---

### **Log Characteristics**

* Timestamp
* Source
* Event type
* Severity
* Message

---

## **C. Introduction of SIEM**

---

### **SIEM – Definition**

**SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** is:

* A centralized security platform
* Combines:

  * SIM (Security Information Management)
  * SEM (Security Event Management)

📌 *SIEM provides real-time monitoring + historical analysis*

---

### **Functions of SIEM**

* Log collection
* Normalization
* Correlation
* Alerting
* Reporting
* Compliance support

---

## **D. SIEM Log Forwarding Configuration**

---

### **Log Forwarding – Concept**

**Log forwarding**:

* Sends logs from devices to SIEM
* Enables centralized analysis

---

### **Common Log Forwarding Methods**

| Method      | Description                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| Syslog      | Standard log transfer protocol |
| Agent-based | Software agent sends logs      |
| API-based   | Application-level integration  |

📌 *Syslog is most commonly used*

---

### **Why Log Forwarding is Important**

* Central visibility
* Faster detection
* Correlation across sources

---

## **E. SIEM Log Correlation and Event Triggering**

---

### **Log Correlation – Definition**

**Log correlation**:

* Combines multiple log events
* Identifies patterns indicating attacks

📌 *Single log = event; multiple correlated logs = incident*

---

### **Examples of Log Correlation**

* Multiple failed logins + successful login
* Firewall alert + IDS alert
* Login from unusual location

---

### **Event Triggering**

**Event triggering**:

* Occurs when correlation rules match
* Generates:

  * Alerts
  * Notifications
  * Incident tickets

📌 *Triggers are rule-based*

---

### **Correlation Rule Components**

* Event type
* Time window
* Threshold
* Severity

---

## 4. **Important Facts / Points for MCQs**

* Log analyzer ≠ SIEM
* SIEM combines SIM + SEM
* Syslog is common log protocol
* Correlation detects complex attacks
* Alerts generated by rules
* Logs are chronological records

---

## 5. **Examples (Exam-Friendly)**

* Firewall sends logs → Log forwarding
* Multiple failed logins → Correlation
* Alert generation → Event triggering
* Central security console → SIEM
* Raw device logs → Log analyzer input

---

## 6. **MCQ Pointers / Exam Traps**

⚠️ **Common Confusions**

* Log ≠ Event ≠ Incident
* Log analyzer ≠ SIEM
* Correlation ≠ Single log analysis
* Alert ≠ Incident
* Syslog ≠ SNMP
