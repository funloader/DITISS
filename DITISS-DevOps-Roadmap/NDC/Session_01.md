# **Session 1 – Introduction to Information Security (PG-DITISS)**

---

## 1. **Concept Overview**

**Information Security** deals with protecting **data, systems, and services** from unauthorized access, misuse, disruption, or destruction.

* Modern cyberspace (Internet, intranet, workplace networks) is **highly vulnerable**
* Threats come from:

  * External attackers
  * **Internal threats (disgruntled employees – major risk)**
* Security focus:

  * **Prevention**
  * **Detection**
  * **Recovery**

## 2. **Key Definitions**

| Term                 | Definition (Exam-Ready)                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Information Security | Protection of information and systems against unauthorized access, modification, or disruption |
| Threat               | Any action or event that can compromise security                                               |
| Vulnerability        | Weakness in design, implementation, or configuration                                           |
| Attack               | Actual attempt to violate security                                                             |
| Risk                 | Potential loss when a threat exploits a vulnerability                                          |
| QoS                  | Network techniques to manage bandwidth, delay, jitter, and packet loss                         |

## 3. **Main Content (From NDC Notes)**

---

### **A. Why Information Security?**

**Reasons security is critical:**

* Increased **number of users & devices**
* **Easy availability of hacking tools**
* Increased **internet bandwidth & computing power**
* Public availability of **hacking manuals**
* **Low skill requirement + high success rate**

📌 *Even non-technical users can launch attacks*

---

### **B. Security – The Money Factor Involved**

**Financial impact of security breaches:**

* **Data loss** → Direct business loss
* **Service downtime** → Revenue loss
* **Reputation damage** → Long-term business impact
* **Legal & compliance penalties**
* **Identity theft costs**

🧠 *Security investment < Cost of breach*

---

### **C. Internet Statistics – Security Perspective**

(Security implications derived from notes)

* Large number of:

  * Connected devices
  * Online services
  * Publicly accessible systems
* Result:

  * **Expanded attack surface**
  * **Higher exposure to DoS, malware, data theft**
* Internet ≠ Trusted environment

📌 *Availability attacks (DoS) are common and costly*

---

### **D. What Needs to Be Secured?**

#### **1. Physical Security**

* Servers
* Power supply
* Environment (temperature, humidity)

📌 *Physical access = total compromise*

#### **2. Logical / Technical Security**

* User IDs & passwords
* Screen locks
* Secure wireless access
* Router & firewall passwords
* Encryption of:

  * Stored data
  * Transmitted data

---

### **E. Vulnerability, Threat & Risk**

#### **Vulnerability**

* Weakness in:

  * Software
  * Hardware
  * Network
  * Configuration

#### **Threat**

* Potential cause of harm
* Example:

  * Malware
  * Insider misuse
  * Network attack

#### **Risk**

> **Risk = Threat + Vulnerability**

* Represents **expected loss**
* Includes:

  * Financial loss
  * Reputation loss
  * Legal consequences

---

### **F. Quality of Service (QoS)**

**QoS** ensures **performance reliability** for critical applications.

#### **Why QoS is important?**

* Voice / Video sensitive to delay
* Network congestion affects services

---

#### **QoS Parameters (High MCQ Value)**

| Parameter   | Meaning                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Packet Loss | Dropped packets due to congestion |
| Latency     | Time taken for packet to travel   |
| Jitter      | Variation in packet delay         |
| Bandwidth   | Maximum data capacity             |
| MOS         | Voice quality score (1–5)         |

📌 *MOS = Mean Opinion Score*

---

#### **QoS Models**

| Model                              | Key Point                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Best Effort                        | No priority, no guarantee    |
| Integrated Services (IntServ)      | Bandwidth reservation        |
| Differentiated Services (DiffServ) | Traffic classes & priorities |

---

## 4. **Important Facts / Points for MCQs**

* Biggest security weakness → **Humans**
* Internal threats > External threats
* Risk formula → **Threat + Vulnerability**
* QoS used in:

  * VoIP
  * Video conferencing
* MOS scale → **1 (worst) to 5 (best)**
* Best Effort QoS → No guarantees

---

## 5. **Examples (Exam-Friendly)**

* Server unplugged accidentally → **Physical security failure**
* DoS attack → **Availability violation**
* Packet delay in VoIP → **High latency & jitter**
* Unauthorized login → **Threat exploiting vulnerability**

---

## 6. **MCQ Pointers / Exam Traps**

⚠️ **Common Confusions:**

* Threat ≠ Attack
* Vulnerability ≠ Risk
* QoS ≠ Security mechanism (it’s performance control)
* Latency ≠ Jitter
* Bandwidth ≠ Throughput
