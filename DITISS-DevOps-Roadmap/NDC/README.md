## 🎯 **Module Objective**

This module trains students to secure, defend, and monitor networks using industry-standard tools and defense mechanisms. It covers:
- Network security fundamentals
- Firewalls (pfSense, iptables, NGFW)
- IDS/IPS (Snort, Suricata, OSSEC)
- VPN & secure tunneling
- UTM, SIEM, log analysis
- Threat detection, mitigation & threat hunting

By the end, students can design, configure, and manage secure networks aligned with real-world enterprise defense models.
