### ❓ Q1. What are different extensions supported by python? What is meaning of .py , .pyc, .pyz, .pyo, .pyd , etc extensions supported by python ?
🔹 1. ``.py`` **— Python Source File**
-  This is the standard Python script file.
-  Contains human-readable source code.
-  Executed directly by the Python interpreter.

✔ Example: ``script.py``

🔹 2. ``.pyc`` **— Compiled Python Bytecode**
-  Automatically generated by Python (in ``__pycache__``).
-  Contains compiled bytecode, not source code.
-  Used to speed up execution for future runs.
-  Not meant to be edited manually.

✔ Example: ``module.cpython-311.pyc``

🔹 3. ``.pyo`` **— Optimized Python Bytecode (Deprecated)**
-  Generated when Python is run with optimization flags (``-O`` or ``-OO``).
-  Contains optimized bytecode (no debug info, possibly removed docstrings).
-  Support removed in newer Python versions (Python 3.5+).

✔ Example:``module.pyo``

🔹 4. ``.pyz`` **— Zipped Python Application**
-  A zip archive containing Python modules, executed as a script.
-  Used by packaging tools (e.g., ``zipapp``).

Runs with: ``python app.pyz``

✔ Example: ``myapp.pyz``

🔹 5. ``.pyd`` **— Python Dynamic Module (Windows)**
-  Equivalent to a shared library (``.so`` in Linux).
-  Used for C/C++ extension modules.
-  Loaded using ``import`` like normal modules.

✔ Example: ``mymodule.pyd``

🔹 6. ``.pyi`` **— Type Hint Stub File**
cContains type annotations only.
-  Used with tools like mypy.
-  Used when Python code is compiled or hidden.

✔ Example: ``module.pyi``

🔹 7. ``.pyw`` **— Python Script (No Console) — Windows**
-  Used for GUI applications on Windows.
-  Runs without opening a terminal window.

✔ Example: ``gui_app.pyw``

🔹 8. ``.whl`` **— Wheel Package**
-  Binary package format for distributing Python libraries.
-  Installed using ``pip``.

✔ Example: ``numpy-1.25.0-cp311-win_amd64.whl``

🔹 9. ``.egg`` **— Old Python Package Format**
-  Pre-wheel packaging format.
-  Mostly replaced by .whl.

✔ Example: ``mypackage.egg``

### ❓ Q a. Check what happens if we print ``math.sqrt`` without any parnthesis ? 
Code
```
import math
print(math.sqrt)
```
Output
```
<built-in function sqrt>
```
Explanation
-  ``math.sqrt`` refers to the function object itself.
-  You are not calling the function — you are only printing its reference.
-  Python prints something like: ``<built-in function sqrt>``
---

### ❓ Q b. What happens if we print ``math.sqrt()`` without passing any number to it ?
Code
```
import math
print(math.sqrt())
```
Output
```
TypeError: sqrt() takes exactly one argument (0 given)

```
-  ``math.sqrt()`` tries to execute the function.
-  The function requires exactly one numeric argument (the number whose square root you want).
-  Since no argument is passed, Python throws a TypeError.

### ❓Q. Can we convert .pyc file to python code? how?

Yes, by using a Python bytecode decompiler.
``.pyc`` files contain compiled bytecode, and tools exist to reverse this bytecode back into Python-like source code.

How to Convert .pyc to .py

1️⃣ **Using uncompyle6 (most popular)**
```
pip install uncompyle6
uncompyle6 -o . yourfile.pyc
```
This creates a .py file with readable Python code.

2️⃣ **Using decompyle3**

```
pip install decompyle3
decompyle3 yourfile.pyc > output.py
```
### ❓Q. What is Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)?

-  GIL is a mechanism in CPython that ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. 
It simplifies memory management but restricts true multithreading for CPU-bound tasks, while still allowing concurrency for I/O-bound tasks.

✅ Where does GIL exist?
Only in CPython, the default and most common Python implementation.
Other Python interpreters do NOT have GIL

### Q. Which language is used to write python interpreter?
-  Python interpreter (CPython) is written in C language.
```
| Interpreter      | Written In                  | Notes                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| CPython          | C                           | Official & default Python implementation |
| PyPy             | RPython (Restricted Python) | Faster, JIT compiler                     |
| Jython           | Java                        | Runs on JVM                              |
| IronPython       | C# (.NET)                   | Runs on .NET CLR                         |
| Stackless Python | C                           | Optimized for concurrency                |
```

### Q. When variable is created what is on stack and what part is on heap ?
-  The variable name (reference) is stored on the Stack
-  The actual object/value is stored on the Heap

### Q. What is a Garbage Collector in Python?
-  The Garbage Collector (GC) in Python is a system that automatically manages memory.
-  Its job is to free memory by deleting objects that are no longer needed by the program.
Python mainly uses:
-  Reference Counting (primary method)
-  Generational Garbage Collection (to remove cyclic references)

### Q. How does Reference Counting work ?
-  Every object in Python has a reference count, which tells how many variables/objects are currently referring to it.
