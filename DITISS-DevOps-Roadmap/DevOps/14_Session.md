## 🚀 **Session 14: Agile, Lean & Their Role in DevOps**

---

### 🧠 **1. Concept Overview**

* **Agile** and **Lean** are modern software development and delivery philosophies.
* In **DevOps**, Agile focuses on **speed and adaptability**, while Lean focuses on **efficiency and waste reduction**.
* Scrum and Kanban are the **most exam-relevant Agile methodologies**.

---

### 📖 **2. Key Definitions**

* **Agile:** Iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes **flexibility, customer feedback, and continuous improvement**.
* **Scrum:** Agile framework based on **time-boxed iterations (sprints)**.
* **Kanban:** Agile method focused on **continuous flow of work**.
* **Lean:** Philosophy aimed at **eliminating waste** and maximizing value.
* **DevOps:** Culture combining **development + operations** for faster delivery.

### 🧩 **3. Main Content (Organized from Notes)**

---

#### 🔄 **Agile**

* Developed to overcome limitations of **waterfall model**.
* Emphasizes:

  * Individuals & interactions
  * Working software
  * Customer collaboration
  * Responding to change

📌 *Agile is adaptive, not predictive.*

---

#### 🏃 **Agile Methodologies**

##### 🔹 **Scrum**

* Work divided into **Sprints** (fixed time, usually 2–4 weeks)
* Defined roles:

  * Product Owner
  * Scrum Master
  * Development Team
* Uses:

  * Product Backlog
  * Sprint Backlog
  * Daily Scrum meetings

**Best For:**

* Projects with **changing requirements**

---

##### 🔹 **Kanban**

* Visual workflow using **Kanban board**
* Focuses on:

  * Limiting Work In Progress (WIP)
  * Continuous delivery
* No fixed iterations

**Best For:**

* Maintenance and support work

---

#### 🧠 **Lean**

* Originated from **manufacturing (Toyota Production System)**.
* Focuses on **value delivery** and **waste elimination**.

**Types of Waste (Exam Focus):**

* Overproduction
* Waiting
* Defects
* Extra processing
* Inventory
* Motion
* Underutilized talent

---

#### ⚙️ **Implementation of Lean**

* Identify value from customer perspective
* Map value stream
* Remove non-value activities
* Improve flow
* Continuously optimize

📌 *Lean is continuous, not one-time.*

---

#### 🔗 **Lean and Agile in DevOps**

* Agile ensures:

  * Fast development
* Lean ensures:

  * Efficient processes
* DevOps integrates:

  * Development
  * Testing
  * Operations

**Combined Benefits:**

* Faster releases
* Reduced waste
* Continuous feedback
* Improved quality

---

### 🎯 **4. Important Facts / Points for MCQs**

* Agile is **iterative**
* Scrum uses **time-boxed sprints**
* Kanban has **no sprints**
* Lean originated in **manufacturing**
* WIP limits are key to Kanban
* Lean focuses on **waste reduction**
* DevOps extends Agile beyond development

---

### 🧪 **5. Examples**

* Scrum → Product development
* Kanban → IT support team
* Lean → Reducing deployment delays
* DevOps → CI/CD pipelines

---

### ⚠️ **6. MCQ Pointers / Exam Traps**

* Scrum ≠ Kanban
* Agile ≠ DevOps
* Lean ≠ Agile (Lean = efficiency, Agile = adaptability)
* Kanban ≠ time-boxed
* DevOps is not a tool


---

✅ **Exam Priority Tip:**

> *PG-DITISS MCQs frequently test Scrum vs Kanban differences, Lean waste types, and Agile-DevOps relationships—revise traps carefully.*
