# ☁️ Cloud API Integration and DC/DR Migration — Sessions 11 & 12

**Duration:** 4 Theory Hours + Lab Assignment
**Module:** DevOps (CDAC PG-DITISS)
**Objective:** To learn how to use Cloud APIs for integration, manage Data Center (DC) and Disaster Recovery (DR) migration, and apply configuration management tools like Chef/Puppet for automation.

## 📘 **Theory Checklist**

### 🔗 Cloud API Integration and Automation
- [x] Understanding **Cloud API integration** (the programmatic interface for cloud resource management).
- [x] Learn how APIs enable automation, monitoring, and scaling.
- [x] Concepts of **Bootstrapping Chef/Puppet Server** for configuration management.

---

### 🏢 Data Center and Disaster Recovery (DC/DR)
- [x] Understanding **DC/DR Migration** strategies (Lift and Shift, Re-platforming, Re-factoring).
- [x] Principles of **DC/DR Storage Synchronization** for data consistency.
- [x] Techniques for **Migration of physical servers to clouds**.
- [x] Implementing high availability (HA) and disaster recovery using cloud services.

---

## 🧪 **Lab Assignments**

### 1. Cloud API Integration for DC/DR Setup
- [x] Implement a scenario demonstrating **Cloud API Integration for DC/DR Setup**.
- [x] Focus on provisioning and de-provisioning resources automatically across two regions/zones.

---

### 2. Automated Migration and Synchronization
- [x] Execute an **Automated Migration and Storage Synchronization** task.
- [x] Simulate migrating data and server configurations between an on-premises or virtual DC and a cloud environment.

---

### 3. Configuration Management for Cloud Migration
- [x] **Configuring Chef/Puppet for Cloud Migration**.
- [x] Use Chef/Puppet recipes/manifests to manage the state of servers *before* and *after* migration.
- [x] Perform a simulated **Physical to Cloud Server Migration**.

---

### 4. High Availability Implementation
- [x] Demonstrate **Implementing High Availability with Cloud API and Configuration Management**.
- [x] Use APIs to provision redundant resources and configuration management to ensure consistent application deployment.
