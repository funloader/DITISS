## 📘 **Theory Checklist**

### 🧩 Introduction to Virtualization
- [ ] Understand the concept of **virtualization** and its purpose in DevOps.  
- [ ] Learn how virtualization abstracts hardware resources to create multiple virtual machines.  
- [ ] Study **Hardware Virtualization**, **Para-Virtualization**, and **Operating System Virtualization**.  

---

### 🧱 Types of Virtualization
- [ ] Explore **Type 1 (Bare-metal)** and **Type 2 (Hosted)** hypervisors.  
- [ ] Identify differences, advantages, and use cases for both.  
- [ ] Understand the role of hypervisors in managing guest operating systems.  

---

### 🧮 Clustering Concepts
- [ ] Learn the fundamentals of **Cluster Architecture**.  
- [ ] Understand **Cluster Requirements** (networking, storage, compute).  
- [ ] Study how clusters enhance scalability, high availability, and load balancing.  

---

### 🧰 Virtualization Components
- [ ] Understand **Cloning**, **Snapshots**, and **Templates** for VMs.  
- [ ] Learn how these features support version control and deployment efficiency.  
- [ ] Explore how virtualization forms the foundation for cloud computing and containerization.

---

## 🧪 **Lab Assignment**

### 🔧 Practical Tasks
- [ ] **Create and configure** a Virtual Machine using **VirtualBox**.  
- [ ] Deploy a simple **code or web application** on the virtual machine.  
- [ ] Practice **VM cloning** and **snapshot management**.  
- [ ] Observe system resource allocation and isolation between VMs.  
- [ ] Verify successful deployment and environment consistency.
