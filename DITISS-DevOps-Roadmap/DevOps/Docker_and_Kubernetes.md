# 🐳 Docker and Kubernetes (Orchestration) — Sessions 20 & 21

**Duration:** 4 Theory Hours + Lab Assignment
**Module:** DevOps (CDAC PG-DITISS)
**Objective:** To introduce the concepts of **Containerization (Docker)** and **Container Orchestration (Kubernetes, Dockerswam)**, and apply them for scalable microservice deployment.

---

## 📘 **Theory Checklist**

### 💻 Foundational Concepts
- [x] Review **Version Control system** and its necessity for containerized applications.
- [x] Introduction to **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** in the context of deployment.
- [x] Deep dive into **Containerization with Docker**.

---

### 🌐 Container Orchestration
- [x] Introduction to **Container Orchestration** and its benefits (scaling, self-healing).
- [x] Study **Kubernetes** as the leading orchestration platform.
- [x] Study **Dockerswam** as an alternative orchestration tool.
- [x] Understanding **Micro Service Deployment** using containers and orchestration.

---

## 🧪 **Lab Assignments**

### 1. Docker Swarm Service Management
- [x] Create a new **Docker image using NGINX**.
- [x] Push the new image to **Docker Hub**.
- [x] Create a **service on Dockerswam**.
- [x] **Scale the service**: Keep initial replicas as 1, increase the replicas to 10, then reduce the replicas to 2.
- [x] **Update the service**: Create a new image by modifying "index.html", push to Docker Hub, and then update the running service to use the new image.

---

### 2. Kubernetes Cluster Configuration
- [x] Configure a Linux machine as a **Master node** using Kubernetes.
- [x] Configure **2 to 3 worker node clusters** and join them to the Master node.
- [ ] *Self-Practice:* Deploy a simple application (e.g., a web server) onto the Kubernetes cluster.
