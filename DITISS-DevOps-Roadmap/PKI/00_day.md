### What is Cryptography? (One-liner)
*Cryptography is the science of securing information using mathematical techniques to ensure confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.*

**Keywords:** Encryption, Cipher, Key, Algorithm, Confidentiality, Integrity.
It protects data by converting readable information into an unreadable form using algorithms and keys. It includes encryption, decryption, cryptanalysis, and cryptology

### Basic Keywords
- *Plaintext*: Original readable data before encryption.
  “Plaintext is human-readable data that needs protection before transmission or storage.”
- *Access Control*: Restricting access to resources based on authentication & authorization.
  “Access control ensures only authorized users can access specific data. Common methods: DAC, MAC, RBAC.”
- *Encryption*: Converting plaintext → ciphertext using an algorithm + key.
- *Decryption*: Converting ciphertext → plaintext using the correct key.
  “Encryption secures data; decryption restores it. Used to prevent unauthorized access during transmission or storage.”
- *Cryptanalysis*: Breaking or bypassing cryptographic systems.
  “Cryptanalysis focuses on finding weaknesses in ciphers—like brute force, frequency analysis, or side-channel attacks.”
- *Cryptology*: Study of cryptography + cryptanalysis
  “Cryptology is the overall field combining encryption techniques and methods to break them.”
- *Encryption Algorithm*: Mathematical function that transforms plaintext to ciphertext.
  “Algorithms define how the encryption happens, while keys decide the strength.”

### Encryption Method
 *The approach/technique used to encrypt plaintext.*
- Why Encryption Method is Needed?
  - To prevent unauthorized data access
  - To secure data integrity
  - To protect data during transit (CIA Triad)
  - To comply with security standards (GDPR, HIPAA)
### **Types of Classical Ciphers**
  - *Substitution Cipher* : Replaces each letter/symbol with another.
