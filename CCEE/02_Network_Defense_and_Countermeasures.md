### 1. A system administrator wants to prevent unauthorized access to a Linux server. Which primary function of iptables will help achieve this?

* [ ] To manage disk partitions
* [ ] To monitor network traffic
* [ ] To filter network traffic and control access
* [ ] To encrypt network packets

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** To filter network traffic and control access
💡 iptables is primarily a packet filtering and firewall tool in Linux. It controls which packets are allowed or blocked, based on rules defined for chains and tables.

</details>

---

### 2. Which of the following chains are present by default in the filter table of iptables?

* [ ] INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD
* [ ] ACCEPT, DENY, REJECT
* [ ] PREROUTING, POSTROUTING, FORWARD
* [ ] FILTER, NAT, MANGLE

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD
💡 The default filter table has three chains: INPUT (for packets destined for the host), OUTPUT (for packets generated by the host), and FORWARD (for packets being routed through the host).

</details>

---

### 3. When a packet arrives at a Linux host, which chain in iptables determines how packets destined for the local system are handled?

* [ ] It handles traffic that is being forwarded between network interfaces.
* [ ] It handles traffic that is destined for the local system.
* [ ] It handles outgoing traffic from the local system.
* [ ] It handles traffic that is being redirected.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** It handles traffic that is destined for the local system.
💡 The INPUT chain processes packets addressed to the host itself, allowing administrators to filter incoming traffic.

</details>

---

### 4. What is the effect of applying the ACCEPT target in an iptables rule?

* [ ] Drops the packet
* [ ] Logs the packet
* [ ] Accepts the packet and allows it to pass through
* [ ] Rejects the packet without any notification

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** Accepts the packet and allows it to pass through
💡 ACCEPT allows matching packets to traverse the network stack without being blocked.

</details>

---

### 5. If no policy is explicitly defined, what is the default behavior of iptables for most chains?

* [ ] ACCEPT
* [ ] REJECT
* [ ] DROP
* [ ] LOG

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** ACCEPT
💡 By default, chains like INPUT, OUTPUT, and FORWARD allow packets unless a different policy is set.

</details>

---

### 6. For which purpose is the NAT table in iptables specifically used?

* [ ] FILTER
* [ ] NAT
* [ ] MANGLE
* [ ] RAW

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** NAT
💡 NAT (Network Address Translation) is used to modify source or destination addresses/ports, enabling IP masquerading and routing across private networks.

</details>

---

### 7. In iptables, what does the DROP action do to a matching packet?

* [ ] Accepts the packet
* [ ] Rejects the packet with a notification
* [ ] Silently discards the packet without notification
* [ ] Logs the packet

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** Silently discards the packet without notification
💡 DROP completely discards the packet, unlike REJECT, which sends an error message to the sender.

</details>

---

### 8. Which target in iptables is designed specifically for recording information about packets?

* [ ] LOG
* [ ] DROP
* [ ] REJECT
* [ ] ACCEPT

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** LOG
💡 The LOG target writes packet information to system logs, allowing monitoring without affecting packet flow.

</details>

---

### 9. Which command correctly lists all current iptables rules?

* [ ] iptables -list
* [ ] iptables -L
* [ ] iptables --show
* [ ] iptables --list-rules

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** iptables -L
💡 `iptables -L` lists all rules for all chains, showing policies, targets, and conditions.

</details>

---

### 10. How can a Linux administrator allow incoming SSH connections using iptables?

* [ ] iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
* [ ] iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
* [ ] iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
* [ ] iptables -A INPUT -s tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
💡 SSH connections target port 22. INPUT chain rules handle packets destined for the host.

</details>

---

### 11. In iptables, which option specifies the network interface a rule applies to?

* [ ] -i
* [ ] -o
* [ ] -t
* [ ] -p

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** -i
💡 `-i` specifies the input interface; `-o` specifies the output interface.

</details>

---

### 12. If no policy is set for the FORWARD chain, what is the default action for packets being routed through the host?

* [ ] ACCEPT
* [ ] DROP
* [ ] REJECT
* [ ] LOG

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** ACCEPT
💡 By default, the FORWARD chain allows packets to traverse the system unless configured otherwise.

</details>

---

### 13. How does iptables evaluate multiple rules within a chain?

* [ ] The first matching rule is applied.
* [ ] All rules must match before any action is taken.
* [ ] Rules are applied in reverse order.
* [ ] The last matching rule is applied.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** The first matching rule is applied.
💡 iptables processes rules sequentially; once a match is found, the corresponding action is executed.

</details>

---

### 14. What does the REJECT target do in iptables?

* [ ] Silently drops the packet
* [ ] Accepts the packet
* [ ] Rejects the packet and sends an error response to the sender
* [ ] Logs the packet for auditing

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** Rejects the packet and sends an error response to the sender
💡 Unlike DROP, REJECT notifies the sender that the packet was refused.

</details>

---

### 15. Which of the following is **not** a valid iptables table?

* [ ] FILTER
* [ ] NAT
* [ ] MANGLE
* [ ] ROUTE

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** ROUTE
💡 iptables has FILTER, NAT, MANGLE, and RAW tables. ROUTE is not a valid iptables table.

</details>

---

### 16. What is the primary purpose of the MANGLE table in iptables?

* [ ] For logging traffic
* [ ] For modifying packet headers
* [ ] For routing decisions
* [ ] For performing NAT (Network Address Translation)

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** For modifying packet headers
💡 MANGLE allows packet modifications such as changing TOS, TTL, or marking packets for routing or QoS.

</details>

---

</details>

---

### 18. In iptables, what does the `-s` option specify?

* [ ] The source IP address
* [ ] The source port
* [ ] The source interface
* [ ] The source MAC address

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Answer</strong></summary>

✅ **Correct Answer:** The source IP address
💡 `-s` is used to match packets from a specific source IP or subnet.

</details>

---

### 19. Which command removes all rules from all chains in iptables?

* [ ] iptables -F
* [ ] iptables -D
* [ ] iptables -Z
* [ ] iptables -X
