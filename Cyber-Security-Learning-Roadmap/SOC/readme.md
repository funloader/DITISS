# SOC Level 1
This path introduces a wide array of essential defensive security topics and real-world analysis scenarios. By completing it, you will gain the knowledge and practical skills needed to become a successful SOC Level 1 Analyst, or to better structure your existing expertise if you are already working in the field.

## Introduction

The Security Operations Center (SOC) is a central hub for securing many large organizations, and junior analysts are among the most numerous and demanding roles in a SOC. In the analyst role, you will work with logs, triage and prioritize alerts, collaborate with your teammates and other departments, and be the first line of defense in reacting to cyber incidents. This comprehensive path covers the necessary technical and operational skills to make you a qualified, universal SOC analyst.

### SOC Role in Blue Team

Looking at the diagram above, top executives like the CEO usually focus on global business objectives and don't manage technical aspects. That's why they hire a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or a similar role who knows the business needs and can create the most suitable security departments.

#### Security Departments
In tiny companies, the IT department takes the role of securing the company. Small to medium-sized companies may have a generic "Information Security" team that does all sorts of tasks. For this room, we will focus on bigger companies with a CISO overseeing multiple security teams, each handling a specific task. For example:

**Red Team:** Offensive security experts, pentesters, or ethical hackers who look for security issues

**GRC Team:** Specialists managing policies and ensuring compliance with regulations like PCI DSS

**Blue Team:** Defensive security experts like SOC analysts, engineers, or incident responders


### Security Operations Center (SOC)

Blue Team is about defensive security, meaning it constantly monitors for attacks and tries to respond to them quickly. Depending on a company's size and sector, Blue Team can include a lot of different roles and subdepartments, usually counting 3 to 50 members total. Now, let's explore the most common Blue Team departments.

That's where you are most likely to start your cyber security journey! SOC is the central hub for an organization's cyber security - they are the first line of defense, work with various alerts, and handle most attacks. You can read more about SOC structure in this room, but an efficient SOC is usually composed of the following roles:

**L1 Analysts:** Junior members who triage alerts and pass complex cases to L2

**L2 Analysts:** Experienced members who investigate more advanced attacks

**Engineers:** Experts in configuring security tools like EDR or SIEM

**Manager:** A person who manages the whole SOC team

### Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT)

If SOC expertise is not enough or the incident goes out of control, you urgently call the "firefighters" - CIRT, also called CSIRT or CERT. The members should have a broad knowledge of cyber threats and handle breaches without depending on tools like EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) or SIEM. A CIRT job is stressful and responsible, but also rewarding. Here are a few CIRT examples:

JPCERT: Japan's CERT handling nation-wide breaches
Mandiant: A private team responding to global cyber incidents
AWS CIRT: Investigates security incidents of AWS customers

### Specialized Defensive Roles

Large companies, technology-focused startups, and government agencies often require narrow and specialized Blue Team roles - exciting and highly valuable, but requiring deep topic knowledge and broad experience in broader fields like SOC or IT. These narrow roles can include:

**Digital Forensics Analyst:** Uncover hidden threats in disk and memory
**Threat Intelligence Analyst:** Gather data about emerging threat groups
**AppSec Engineer:** Maintain a secure software development lifecycle
**AI Researcher:** Study AI threats and how to defend against them

### SOC Path
Starting as a SOC L1 analyst may be a great option to broaden your cyber world awareness and better understand the more specialized roles. Moreover, even the entry-level SOC L1 role can be fun and engaging: You will deal with real attacks, protect the company from advanced threat groups, and learn a lot during the process. 

#### Internal SOC vs MSSP
Not every organization has the expertise to operate a SOC on its own and relies on a Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP), a company that delivers outsourced security services, most commonly SOC, to its clients. Working at MSSP is typically high-pressure, but it is also a good option to quickstart your career. While we recommend applying for any open SOC position as your first job, it's also important to understand the differences:

Internal SOC vs MSSP Comparison

| Topic | Internal SOC | MSSP |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Scenario Example** | You work in a SOC team of the bank and protect the bank's systems | You work for a global MSSP protecting its sixty customers in Europe |
| **Working Pace** | You usually have calm shifts without too much time pressure | Your shift usually starts from a queue of urgent alerts to analyze |
| **Security Tools** | You work with just a few tools, but need to know them very well | You have to work with sixty diverse security tools and platforms |
| **Incident Practice** | You saw and learned from just two major cyber attacks last year | Every week, you deal with attacks and breaches, and can learn from it |
