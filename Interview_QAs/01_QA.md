## 3️⃣ Policy Compliance: Tools & Policies

### 🔹 One-Line Definition

Policy compliance ensures infrastructure and workloads adhere to **security and governance standards**.

---

### 🔹 A. OPA / Gatekeeper

**What it does:**
Enforces policies at admission time in Kubernetes.

**Interview Answer:**
“OPA Gatekeeper blocks non-compliant resources before deployment.”

**Examples:**

* Enforce non-root containers
* Block privileged pods

---

### 🔹 B. IAM Policies

**What it does:**
Controls **who can do what** on cloud resources.

**Interview Answer:**
“IAM policies enforce least-privilege access across users and workloads.”

---

### 🔹 C. Organization Policies

**What it does:**
Applies **org-wide constraints** (GCP / AWS Organizations).

**Examples:**

* Block public IPs
* Restrict regions

---

### 🔹 D. Pod Security Standards (PSS)

**What it does:**
Defines pod-level security baselines.

**Levels:**

* Privileged
* Baseline
* Restricted

---

### 🔹 E. Jenkins (Pipeline Security)

**What it does:**
Enforces security checks during CI/CD.

**Examples:**

* SAST / DAST scans
* Image scanning
* Secret detection

## 4️⃣ Jenkinsfile Too Large — How Do You Refactor It?

### 🔹 One-Line Definition

Refactoring Jenkinsfiles improves **maintainability, reuse, and scalability**.

### 🔹 Interview-Style Answer

“I modularize Jenkinsfiles using shared libraries and split stages logically.”

---

### 🔧 Best Practices

#### 1. Use **Shared Libraries**

```groovy
@Library('ci-shared-lib') _
build()
test()
deploy()
```

#### 2. Split by Stages

* Build
* Test
* Security Scan
* Deploy

#### 3. Use Functions

```groovy
def buildApp() { ... }
```

#### 4. Externalize Config

* YAML / JSON
* Environment variables

---

### 🔹 Keywords

`shared libraries`, `pipeline as code`, `modular CI`

### ❌ Common Mistakes

* One massive Jenkinsfile
* Hardcoding environment logic

### 🎯 Role Relevance
